#SELECTING VARIABLES TO TEST
#The aim of this analysis is to test the relationship between two numerical variables via linear regression. 
#In particular, the relationship between the average monthly time spent playing (avg_monthly_hrs_gaming) and
#the average monthly amount spent on downloadable content (avg_monthly_expenditure_dlc) will be analysed.

#What's expected is to see a higher expenditure among those who spend more time playing. In other words, the time spent 
#playing (explanatory variable) is expected to be predictive of the amount of money a gamer will spend on downloadable
#content (response variable).

#Based on all this a set of hypotheses was created:
#H0: β1 = 0
#HA: β1 ≠ 0

#β1 is the average change in monthly expenditure associated with a one unit increase in monthly hours spent playing.

#To rephrase it, the null hypothesis predicts a non-significant level of predictability between the time spent playing
#and the monthly expenditure on downloadable content, while the alternative hypothesis predicts a significant
#impact of monthly hours spent playing on the average monthly expenditure of the player.
